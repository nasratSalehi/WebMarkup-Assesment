				<p>
				Amsterdam is de hoofdstad and de meest volkrijke stad in heel Nederland. Amsterdam bevindt zich in de provincie Noord Holland.
				As the commercial capital of the Netherlands and one of the top financial centres in Europe, Amsterdam is considered an alpha-world city.
				Amsterdam is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Europe, 
				receiving more than 4.63 million international visitors annually, this is excluding the 16 million day-trippers visiting the city every year.
				Two-thirds of the hotels are located in the city's centre.
				De Wallen, also known as Walletjes or Rosse Buurt, 
				is a designated area for legalised prostitution and is Amsterdam's largest and most well known red-light district.
				This neighbourhood has become a famous attraction for tourists. It consists of a network of roads and alleys containing several hundred small, 
				one-room apartments rented by sex workers who offer their services from behind a window or glass door, typically illuminated with red lights.

					<p>
					Amsterdam doesn't need an introduction. 
					Everybody has heard of it and knows what it's famous for: 
					canal cruises, coffeeshops and museums (world class are the Van Gogh and the Rijks).
					But there is more to it. Step outside the touristy city center and explore the borough of Amsterdam West. 
					A lively residential area with a rich variety of people, cultures and history.
					</p>
					<p>
					Bos en Lommerweg is the main shopping street of this neighbourhood. 
					It's the wonderful multi-cultural mix with lots of small shops and Turkish and Moroccan cafes and patisseries, 
					alternated with hip and trendy cafes.
					If you come from Sloterdijk, continue the walk here. Behind the Lidl supermarket parking lot is a leafy footpath along the ring road.
					The western part of Leeuwendalerspad is a block of tiny houses. Note the hatch that was used to fill the coal cellar.
					Walk a section of the Bos en Lommerweg mentioned above and through some greeneries. On your right is a small petting zoo with interesting aviaries.
					Over the foot bridge is the Erasmuspark. The eastern section has some old trees and flower fields.
					Walk down Vespuccistraat, often called "the most beautiful street of Amsterdam": majestic houses in the Amsterdam School style. 
					The Jeruzalem church is a prime example of the Amsterdam School, with its brickwork, symmetry and art work.
